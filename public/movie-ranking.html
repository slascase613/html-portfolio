<h1>The Best Movies According to Samuel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies off all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3> A Prince in New York</h3>
    
<p>This is my favorite movie.I like that movie because of the 
love story told in it. A prince that put himself in the 
most humble appearance to find a girl that would love him 
for himself and not for his royalty. </p>

<h3>Transformers</h3>

<p> Intelligent machine transformable into robot and car at 
the same time is fascinating. That's what makes me like that 
movie.</p>

<h3>Maman j’ai raté l’avion 2 </h3>

<p>This is the story of a little boy who got on the wrong plane 
while traveling with his extended family. He's spotted by 2 thieves, who 
have a hard time with him as he sets traps for them. "Home Alone" is 
the original title of this movie. </p>
